Diane Hansen is a long time volunteer working with a variety of health related nonprofits and humanitarian organizations. Besides travelling around the world with medical teams, Diane has devoted much of her life to advocating for children with medical needs - physically, educationally and emotionally - and providing safe and healthy homes for them while they have treatment in the US. She has created many programs in rural areas of Guatemala including a midwife education &amp; support group. In her continuing role as cofounder of a Child's Passport to Health, Diane is committed to supporting continued education for children returning home that otherwise would not have the opportunity, and for finding resources for children with ongoing medical needs once they return home.
