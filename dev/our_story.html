      For the past two decades, we have been on an amazing journey, one that has taken us to the remote regions of impoverished countries, to operating rooms as far away as Nepal and as close as Seattle, to board rooms and living rooms and the dinner tables of families who, like us, have one common goal – to see their children live healthy, happy and fulfilling lives.

      Our first steps on this journey seemed simple enough – taking in a sick child from abroad for a few months while they received medical care in the U. S., or accompanying a team of surgeons to a third world country to perform pediatric surgery.  We had no idea that those first steps would eventually lead us to where we are today, combining those experiences and our mutual passions to begin a new adventure: an organization committed to helping children connect with the health care they need.

      Our attitude and passion are to treat the “whole” child, providing them with an academic education as well as educating them on their specific medical condition and self-care. We also follow each child as they grow and mature whether they need more medical care or not, ensuring they have access to any follow-up procedures. It is a privilege to watch these children mature, advance in their community, become parents, have careers and give back.  It is an opportunity that motivates our passion to continue.

      We work better knowing we are only a piece of the puzzle that it takes to complete the total care of each child.  Finding the children who need our help, connecting them with donated health care and placing them with temporary host families requires the commitment and passion of many individuals, all working together as part of the puzzle.  Working with others that are like-minded inspires us. That is why our approach is collaborative, working with partnering non-profits, hospitals, clinics, doctors, airlines and volunteers around the world to provide each child we serve with all they need for their journey to the U.S and ultimately, improved heath.
