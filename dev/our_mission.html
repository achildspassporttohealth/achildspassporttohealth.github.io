      Our mission is to improve the on-going quality of care for children through surgical/medical intervention and education, in partnership with their biological and host families. To that end, our approach is collaborative and holistic – we are passionate about treating the whole child and providing them not only with the medical care specific to their condition, but also ensuring that each child returns home with the resources and education they will need to continue to grow and thrive.
