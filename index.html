      Every day children around the world suffer and die from health conditions that could be treated, if only they had access to the medical care they need. But what if they could be connected to that care and brought to a place where everything they need is provided by the generosity of donors? What a difference it would make in the lives of these children!
      </p>
      <p>
      Child’s Passport to Health is a charitable organization working with international and local agencies, doctors, hospitals and other non-profit partners to bring children to the U.S. for donated medical care they cannot receive in their own countries.  While here, they stay with a host family until their treatment is complete and they are able to return home.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our approach is collaborative and holistic – we are passionate about treating the whole child and providing them not only with the medical care specific to their condition but also ensuring that each child returns home with the resources and education they will need to continue to grow and thrive.  While in the U.S. for care, children are not only given the opportunity to continue their academic education, they are educated about their medical condition, including self-care.

        Betty Elaine Hill, 1926-2016.
        <br/>
        Betty, mother of board member Rebecca Snyders, and her husband Lowell were always supportive of her daughter’s involvement in bringing children to the US for medical care. Betty formed a special bond with Nathalia from Ecuador after meeting her and her host family. A memorial donation was made to CP2H after Betty’s passing in February.

        David Mann, 1942- 2016
        <br/>
        David and his wife Els were active supporters of a Child’s Passport to Health. Over the years they provided a loving host home to eight children who came to the U.S. for medical care, often remaining involved with the children and their families after they returned to their home countries. David, a veterinarian and horse enthusiast, even taught one of their host children to ride and rope cattle. Els named CP2H as the recipient of David’s memorials, allowing David’s legacy to continue helping children around the world.
